This file provides details into the process for controlling a Nilex GXR2 with voice commands from Alexa.  It uses a Raspberry Pi as the interface between an Alexa skill and the GXR2.  The raspberry pi needs a standard load of raspbian buster with python installed.  Then, the alexaskill.py program needs to be downloaded to the raspberry pi, and nkrok needs to be installed and run in a dedicated terminal session to create a tunnel to the public network for connection to alexa.  An alexa skill needs to be built to allow voice commmands to be passed to the pi.  The JSON file for that script is in a file called pi.json in this directory.

This project requires detailed knowledge over a number of disciplines, and has a medium level of complexity.  If you have no experience writing amazon skills, there is a very good tutorial that you should complete at the following URL.  https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/wp-content/uploads/Eigenen-Raspberry-Pi-Alexa-Skill-entwickeln-und-Pi-fernsteuern-1024x682.jpg

Once you've done that, you'll be ready to attempt this project.

Some interesting facts about the Niles GXR2::

1.  It has its own internal network, complete with DHCP server.  Therefore, you can't directly connect it to your local area network.  Fortunately, Raspberry Pi 4s have both wired and wireless connections
