Using a Raspberry Pi to control a Niles GXR2

On a raspberry pi 3b+ or above computer with raspbian buster installed and apache properly configured and running, copy the following files from this directory into the /var/www/html directory on the pi:
index.html

getstatus.php
controller.php
setzone.php
niles.php
vol,php
nav.php

Connect the wired connection of a raspberry pi to the expansion port on the Niles GXR2.  Connect the wireless network on the pi to your local area network.
Use the ifconfig command to get the IP address of the wireless connection.
From a computer on your local network, open a web browser and enter the IP as the URL to access the web server.

You can control the Niles GXR2 from the web site on the pi.  You will probably want to change the zone and device names to match your system, as I haven't figured out how to pull that information out of the GXR2.

If you also want the display to show which device is selected in a particular zone, I wrote a c++ program that collects status packets from the GXR2 and stores the status information in a file.  You can download the getstatus.cpp file and then compile and run it in a dedicated terminal session.  When its running, the controller display will read the file and set the background color to blue for the active input.  I'll provide additional details as I work toward a first release of this project.
